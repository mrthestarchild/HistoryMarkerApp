Later \u0022Reporter\u0022 owners were Dr. Alf H. H. Toler, John Hoeny, Jr., George S. Anderson, and Marshall Bernard Hanks, a former delivery boy for the paper who was publisher from 1906 to 1948.  In 1911 the \u0022Reporter\u0022 bought the \u0022News,\u0022 resulting in the present name.  Hanks and Houston Harte of San Angelo formed the Harte-Hanks organization, now a national communications firm, which includes the \u0022Reporter-News,\u0022 whose motto is:  \u0022Without or with offense to friends or foes we sketch your world exactly as it goes.\u0022 -Byron.

Joined by his two brothers, Thornton soon expanded his business.  In 1925 he added dry goods, followed by a drug store and feed store in 1929.  Radio and refrigeration departments were added in 1931.  By 1937 Thornton\u0027s filled an entire block of Oak Street, adding a cafe, a beauty shop, and shoe department.  In 1941 a franchise for selling new Studebaker cars was added.  The one-story properties were renovated in 1947 into a four-story structure of more than 100,000 square feet.  Thornton\u0027s was famous for its Christmas displays.  In 1959 the largest fire in Abilene\u0027s history gutted the Thornton property.  Reconstruction began at once.  After the deaths of E. L. Thornton in 1964 and his son Charles Eugene Thornton in 1965, surviving family members sold their interests to a chain store based in St. Louis.  Thornton\u0027s continued in business under new ownership until 1985.  \r\n\r\n(1996)",

An 1884 business directory noted that the community included steam flour and saw mills, three churches and a school, a doctor, wagonmaker, and general store. After Townsen died in 1891 in a mill accident, a new post office opened at the Smith and Adams general store. John T. Adams, first postmaster of Adamsville, and the Rev. McCall Smith were business partners at the store. In the late 1880s, Rev. Smith and 19 charter members met in L. Jasper and Mary Ann Townsen\u0027s home to organize Pleasant Valley Cumberland Presbyterian Church, now Adamsville Presbyterian Church. Samuel and Fannie Straley platted Adamsville in 1908. A newspaper article the following year mentioned Adamsville\u0027s ice house, Ladies\u0027 Missionary Society, Literary Society, and Woodmen of the World Camp. Straley\u0027s School (c. 1885) was also the church for Baptist and Presbyterian congregations. County commissioners created Adamsville School District No. 15 in 1908 and trustees built a new schoolhouse; a larger 1922 schoolhouse was destroyed by fire in 1942. Adamsville consolidated with Lampasas schools in 1964. The Adamsville Community Building was originally a G.I. vocational school for veterans of World War II. J. W. Mitchell organized the Adamsville Volunteer Fire Department about 1967. Adamsville has evolved from a frontier settlement to an active rural community with ongoing events such as church activities, twice-monthly fiddling jam sessions, and community barbecues to welcome hunters during deer season. 175 Years of Texas Independence * 1836-2011",

After the death of his parents in Florida, he moved in 1854 to live with family in San Antonio. Conrad worked as a store clerk until the advent of the Civil War, when he enlisted in the Confederate Army. After the war, he established a trading company at Fort McKavett in Menard County. In 1875 Conrad partnered with Charles Rath, the notable frontier buffalo hide merchant. The pair opened a store and hide yard near Fort Griffin, under the name Conrad \u0026 Rath. The store was a provision point along the Great Western Trail for both buffalo hunters and South Texas cattle herders. In 1878 Conrad \u0026 Rath opened a new store on the flat at Fort Griffin. They were advertised as the largest stock supplier west of Fort Worth. When the buffalo market declined sharply, Conrad was able to profit from selling the vast quantities of bone left behind by hunters, which was ground into fertilizer. \r\n  In 1881, with the closing of Fort Griffin, Conrad moved south to Albany, opened a business and eventually served as Shackleford County Commissioner. By the 1880s, he and his new business partner, John Bradley, were heavily involved in the sheep trade. When Albany\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s wool market opened in 1887, F.E. Conrad \u0026 Co. offered some 700,000 pounds of wool for sale. Conrad married twice: first in 1872 to Davidella Ella McGavock, and then to Rose Ella Matthews in 1881\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dwith one child from Davidella and five from Rose. In 1891, Frank Conrad retired to his Chimney Creek Ranch in Shackleford County. He died at his Albany residence on May 4, 1892, and was buried in Albany Cemetery.   ",

Before and after the Civil War, routes developed for driving herds through Texas to sell in Missouri and Kansas.

In 1868, members of the Barber Watkins Reynolds family drove cattle to New Mexico and California from the Fort Griffin area.In 1874, John T. Lytle drove 3,500 head of longhorns from south Texas to Nebraska on a new trail, which he determined could sustain cattle to a shipping point at Dodge City, Kansas. The route became known as the Western, Fort Griffin or Dodge City Trail, and Fort Griffin served as an important watering and supply point. The trail began near Bandera and proceeded to Baird, where it fanned out at several points for optimum grazing. North of Albany, the route took drovers toward Fort Griffin, crossing the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in this vicinity (1/4 mi. N) and at other upriver points. Multiple paths continued northward, merged again and finally crossed the Red River in Wilbarger County.Two years later, between 73,000 and 108,000 head--about a quarter of Texas\u0027 northern-bound cattle--came through the Fort Griffin area. By 1879, as rail lines extended across the Eastern Trail area, the Western Trail became the primary Texas cattle route and continued as such until the last drive, led by John Blocker in 1893. By then, three to five million cattle had passed through this area on their way to northern markets. Cattle raising continues to be important in Shackelford County, a legacy of the early trail.

SE) donated by a Mr. Middleton, who asked that the structure be named Alma Hall in memory of his daughter. The hall was shared with a Masonic Lodge and a Methodist congregation. Elder Isaac McMurray served as pastor of the Alma Hall Church until 1884, when it merged with the Ebenezer Church. Soon after the consolidation, the congregation moved to the railroad town of Aledo. Here the members worshiped in the community schoolhouse until a sanctuary was completed at this site in 1891. In 1913 it was replaced by a larger structure, built under the supervision of Joe Hopkins and with the assistance of church members. Later additions to the site were made to meet the demands of the congregation\u0027s continued growth. For over a century the First Baptist Church of Aledo has been instrumental in the development of the surrounding area.

        "SpeakingInformation": "First Baptist Church Of Aledo This congregation was organized on September 25, 1879. The first church building was located on land (2.5 mi. SE) donated by a Mr. Middleton, who asked that the structure be named Alma Hall in memory of his daughter. The hall was shared with a Masonic Lodge and a Methodist congregation. Elder Isaac McMurray served as pastor of the Alma Hall Church until 1884, when it merged with the Ebenezer Church. Soon after the consolidation, the congregation moved to the railroad town of Aledo. Here the members worshiped in the community schoolhouse until a sanctuary was completed at this site in 1891. In 1913 it was replaced by a larger structure, built under the supervision of Joe Hopkins and with the assistance of church members. Later additions to the site were made to meet the demands of the congregation\u0027s continued growth. For over a century the First Baptist Church of Aledo has been instrumental in the development of the surrounding area. Pastors here have included many prominent Baptist preachers, and church members have actively served as leaders of the community.

The McGill brothers attended school in Flatonia, Fayette County, Texas.  In 1904 Claude McGill established small ranches in Fayette and Nueces counties. In 1911 he and his brother Frank  formed a partnership and in 1916 they purchased the Santa Rosa Ranch in Kenedy County, Texas.  Frank married Annie Lake in 1905 and Claude married Eva Rowland in 1922.   Both families settled in Alice, Texas.  The McGill brothers helped organize Jim Wells County and were active members of the Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.  Claude served as vice-president of the association in 1935; Frank served as president in 1936.  The McGill brothers became prominent south Texas ranchers and noted experts in the cattle business.  Frank built this structure in 1941 to provide offices for the family ranching operations.  According to family tradition the building was patterned after San Antonio\u0027s Alamo Museum which had impressed Frank during a visit in 1940.  The building exhibits Greek influences and features a distinctive corbelled stone parapet.  In 1975 heirs of the McGill brothers donated this building to the South Texas Museum Corporation.\r\n\r\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmark - 1994",

This part of Collin County was well populated by 1876 when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad built a water supply stop on Cottonwood Creek near this site. The railroad stop and newly created town lots established a center of commerce for local farmers and their families and provided better equipment and broader markets for agricultural production. The surrounding open prairie soon was developed into small family farms.\r\n   The Houston and Texas Central Railroad filed documents to create the town of Allen from the James L. Read survey in 1876. The village was named for Ebenezer Allen, a former Republic and State of Texas attorney general and a founder of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. A dry goods store, barber shop, and school soon opened in the rapidly growing town. Sam Bass reportedly led an outlaw gang that robbed the Allen Depot on February 22, 1878. This was probably the first successful train robbery in Texas.\r\n   By 1884 the town of Allen had three churches, a flour mill, and a population of 350. In 1908 the Texas Traction Company built an electric railway through town, calling it the Interurban. The citizenry numbered 550 by 1915. Allen was incorporated in 1953 with 400 residents. Electric railway service ended in 1948 but railway freight service continued. Strong economic growth in the Dallas-Fort Worth area helped the town\u0027s population grow to include more than 19,000 citizens in the 1990s. (1998)",
        "SpeakingInformation": "   Fertile land and plentiful water drew settlers to this area from as early as the 1840s. This part of Collin County was well populated by 1876 when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad built a water supply stop on Cottonwood Creek near this site. The railroad stop and newly created town lots established a center of commerce for local farmers and their families and provided better equipment and broader markets for agricultural production. The surrounding open prairie soon was developed into small family farms.\r\n   The Houston and Texas Central Railroad filed documents to create the town of Allen from the James L. Read survey in 1876. The village was named for Ebenezer Allen, a former Republic and State of Texas attorney general and a founder of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. A dry goods store, barber shop, and school soon opened in the rapidly growing town. Sam Bass reportedly led an outlaw gang that robbed the Allen Depot on February 22, 1878. This was probably the first successful train robbery in Texas.\r\n   By 1884 the town of Allen had three churches, a flour mill, and a population of 350. In 1908 the Texas Traction Company built an electric railway through town, calling it the Interurban. The citizenry numbered 550 by 1915. Allen was incorporated in 1953 with 400 residents.

Russell\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s home was located south of Rowlett Creek near present-day Jupiter Road. The church services became part of the far-reaching Dallas circuit and were presided over by multiple traveling ministers.

However, when the railroad came through in 1876, the church was moved several miles away to Plano. \r\n  The community, which the church had served, was organized as Allen in 1876. Area Methodists were eager to establish a church closer to their community. Early meetings were most likely held in the Allen Schoolhouse, but soon after, the Baptists opened their church doors to let the Methodists worship independently. The first known Allen pastor was Methodist camp preacher and revivalist Rev. George S. Gatewood, who held camp meetings under a brush arbor at Pegues Springs, southeast of town. The Methodist Church purchased a parcel of land in 1884, but it is unclear if a church was built on this site. A second plot they bought was on the corner of S.

The Holcomb family acquired land in Cherokee County and soon became active in local churches and communities. \r\n\r\nA family reunion was organized in 1897 to honor Joseph and Zachariah Holcomb and to allow kin to renew acquaintances with long absent family members. Held at Cold Springs near Alto, the first reunion was attended by about 200 Holcombs. They arrived by horse and buggy and camped out in tents at the site. The reunion continued year after year and drew more family members from near and far. \r\n\r\nIn the 1950s family members contributed to the construction of a pavilion and changed the Tuesday through Thursday meeting to a Saturday and Sunday schedule. Held the second week in July, the Holcomb family reunion has met for six generations and more than 100 years to share food and entertainment along with the events and accomplishments of its members.

A community known as Morrill grew up around the orchard operation and included a school, commissary, post office and worker housing. The panic of 1907, followed by a blight in 1914, killed the peach orchards, but the company continued in operation with other produce until the economic collapse of 1929 signaled its demise. At the turn of the 21st century, the superintendent\u0027s house stood as the only visible reminder of this part of the county\u0027s agricultural history.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(2002)\r\n",

In 1896 Ezell built a cotton gin on his land located halfway between the communities of Alvarado and Cahill; it became a major business in rural Johnson County.  Although the cotton gin with its wooden siding was destroyed in an 1899 fire, Ezell rebuilt before the 1900 season began and installed new equipment.  Cotton production continued to expand in the area and Ezell became a successful gin owner and farmer.  J. Otto McLeroy, Sr. (1883-1966) took over operations at the gin in 1917, and it became known as the McLeroy Gin.  Cotton buyers were attracted to Alvarado by two rail lines that intersected there, bound for major cotton markets in Dallas, Fort Worth and Waco.

The aqueduct system consists of 322 miles of concrete pressure pipe--the longest pipeline supervised by the Reclamation Bureau to this date.  Construction costs ($83,799,000) covered the following items:  municipal and industrial water, $76,975,000; flood control, $2,833,000; fish and wildlife, $2,891,000; recreation, $1,100,000.  Water cost will be repaid to federal government, with interest, over a 50-year period.  This is largest repayment contract ever made between a water authority and the U.S. Government.  \r\n     This section of pipe is identical to that utilized in segment of the aqueduct two miles west of this marker.  This pipe section is 78 inches in diameter, 22 feet in length and weighs 36,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nIncise on back:  This marker contributed by Gifford-Hill-American, Inc., Concrete Pressure Pipe Manufacturers.

On February 22, 1891, seven men and women met there and organized as the First Methodist Episcopal Church, South, under the leadership of the Rev. J.W. Groves. The Rev. J.W. Sims arrived later that year to serve as pastor.\r\n  Many of the church\u0027s early ministers lived in nearby Rockport, serving a congregation there and traveling to Aransas Pass twice monthly for Sunday services. First Methodist Church constructed its first sanctuary in late 1892 on what is now South McCampbell Street and shared it with the local Christian church, the second congregation to organize in the community. Rockport and Aransas Pass Methodists not only shared a pastor in the early years, but also met frequently for picnics and fellowship. Pastors serving the two congregations added an Ingleside charge, but in 1940 the Aransas Pass church established a full-time pastorate during a boom in the city\u0027s economy.\r\n  Over the years, members of First Methodist built new facilities and survived several major storms. Following the devastation of Hurricane Celia in 1970, the church\u0027s Education Wing served as the Aransas Emergency Hospital for four months and the Fellowship Hall became a community communications center. Through outreach and service programs, as well as fellowship, worship, education and music, the congregation continues to support and sustain residents of Aransas Pass. (2005)",

Over the next forty-nine years Hayter would establish or serve sixteen Cumberland Presbyterian churches. As with many pioneer preachers, Hayter worked in another procession, as a surveyor, to augment his income.\r\n  The Hayters moved to Tarrant County in 1869, where Andrew quickly made a name for himself as a preacher, civic leader and surveyor. During the early 1870s a tiny settlement developed on the edge of Hayter\u0027s property, and he petitioned for a post office in 1875. The post office was called Haytersville.\r\n  Hayter had already founded two churches, a school, and a Masonic Lodge in the area when he was asked in 1876 to locate the railroad through eastern Tarrant County and lay out a tiny, half-mile-square settlement between Dallas and Fort Worth. The railroad designers needed in-depth knowledge of the area and its terrain, as well as a plentiful source of timber to construct the road bed. Andrew Hayter could supply the necessary surveying knowledge, and also owned property filled with large timbers that could be furnished to the railroad. When the railroad offered to name their new town Hayter, the reverend declined the offer and instead gave the town the name Arlington, after Robert E. Lee\u0027s Virginia estate. The birth of Arlington caused the demise of tiny Hayterville. The post office was soon moved to the new town and Hayterville was abandoned. (2009)",

They had two children, Elizabeth \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Eveline\u00E2\u20AC\u009D Thomas and Alfred \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Sylvester\u00E2\u20AC\u009D Thomas. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Alabama. When Jacob\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s wife, Hannah, died, he married Lucindy Knight in 1839. Jacob\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s second wife, Lucindy passed on and he and his son, Sylvester, moved to Arkansas. Between 1850 and 1855, Jacob and Sylvester moved to Erath County, Texas. Sylvester married Araminta Benge and they had three daughters, Mary, Sarah and Adeline. \r\n  Very soon after 1860, the Jacob Thomas family moved to Henderson County. Sylvester volunteered as a Confederate Soldier but died from the flu during training. Jacob continued to care for his daughter-in-law and her children. Not only was he farming but also raised cattle. In 1875, Sylvester\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s eldest daughter, Mary, married J.M. Hall. In 1877, Mary died, most likely during childbirth, and was buried on the family farm, the site that would become Thomas Cemetery. In 1880, Jacob Thomas died and was buried in the family cemetery. \r\n Descendants of Jacob Thomas that lived on this land are buried here, including Araminta Benge Thomas, Adeline Thomas and her husband, Abel \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Matthew\u00E2\u20AC\u009D Edwards, and several young children. This small family cemetery is a reminder of pioneer families and the struggles they faced.",

One of John Goodgame\u0027s daughters, Mary Ann, died while he was at war. Hers is the first recorded burial (1863) in this cemetery. In 1901, Goodgame officially deeded two acres of land here for one dollar to three cemetery trustees: Benjamin McGee, E.B. Stokes and Levi Trammell. Among those interred in Goodgame Cemetery are veterans of military conflicts, including the Civil War, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.

It is named for the Rounsavall family, which settled in Henderson County around 1857. Arba Monroe Rounsavall (1843 \u00E2\u20AC\u201C 1926), a businessman who owned and operated a gristmill and later a cotton gin, owned this property.  He and his wife, Fannie Emeline (Carter) Rounsavall (c. 1835 \u00E2\u20AC\u201C 1887), are among those buried here. Ownership of this land later passed onto their son, farmer and school board trustee James Monroe Rounsavall (1871 \u00E2\u20AC\u201C 1952), who is also interred here with his wife, Clyde (also Clide) Oma (Knowles) Rounsavall (1871 \u00E2\u20AC\u201C 1939).

Abraham Grant, who came to Austin in 1881, led the congregation until 1888, when he became a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Dr. William Laws served here during the first years of the twentieth century and was later president of Paul Quinn College.\r\nAn established part of Austin\u0027s black community for over 100 years, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church continues to uphold the ideals upon which it was founded.\r\nTexas Sesquicentennial - 1986",

Early Educational Efforts included an 1870s subscription school in a one-room frame schoolhouse on Onion Creek. The first public school began in the early 1880s and was held in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church near Onion Creek and adjoining Live Oak Cemetery.  This building was also known as \u0022Old Rock Church,\u0022 and Professor Alfred H. Decherd was the principal.\r\n\r\nThe building of the International and Great Northern Railroad tracks through Manchaca in 1881 brought an influx of new settlers and increased economic activity.  In 1883 a new public schoolhouse was built immediately east of this site.  The one-story brick building with bell tower was expanded with a second story in the 1910s.

        "DisplayInformation": "In 1947, the Catholic leaders of the San Antonio, Galveston and Dallas Dioceses voted to surrender counties within their Ecclesiastical jurisdiction to create the Diocese of Austin. This move led to the raising of St. Mary Church in Austin to a Cathedral Church and the selection of Louis J. Reicher, the Prothonotary Apostolic and Chancellor of the Diocese of Galveston, as the first Bishop of the Austin Diocese. The new diocese included parishes, missions, stations, chapels, schools, hospitals and St. Edward\u0027s University.Soon after his installation, Bishop Reicher began construction projects for the diocese. In all, he would build or remodel about 260 buildings. He also helped organize the Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, strongly endorsed the Cursillo movement, and established the Diocesan Committee on Human Rights during his 23-year tenure. Reicher\u0027s successor, Bishop Vincent Harris, focused on atrtracting Mexican Americans to religious vocations and worked with social justice issues, all while the diocese ordained record numbers during his 14-year tenure.Since the 1980s, major focuses of the diocese have included social ministry, missions and formation laity.

        "SpeakingInformation": "In 1947, the Catholic leaders of the San Antonio, Galveston and Dallas Dioceses voted to surrender counties within their Ecclesiastical jurisdiction to create the Diocese of Austin. This move led to the raising of St. Mary Church in Austin to a Cathedral Church and the selection of Louis J. Reicher, the Prothonotary Apostolic and Chancellor of the Diocese of Galveston, as the first Bishop of the Austin Diocese. The new diocese included parishes, missions, stations, chapels, schools, hospitals and St. Edward\u0027s University.Soon after his installation, Bishop Reicher began construction projects for the diocese. In all, he would build or remodel about 260 buildings. He also helped organize the Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, strongly endorsed the Cursillo movement, and established the Diocesan Committee on Human Rights during his 23-year tenure. Reicher\u0027s successor, Bishop Vincent Harris, focused on atrtracting Mexican Americans to religious vocations and worked with social justice issues, all while the diocese ordained record numbers during his 14-year tenure.Since the 1980s, major focuses of the diocese have included social ministry, missions and formation laity. The diocese has aided non-Catholics as well through its hospitals, healthcare and daycare centers, and other health facilities.

In 1868 he was one of the organizers of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church (now Gethsemane Lutheran Church) in Austin.\r\n  Swedish king Oscar II knighted Palm in 1884 for his service to Sweden and Texas\u0027 Swedish immigrants. A devoted book collector, Palm amassed a large library which he donated to the University of Texas in 1897, increasing its holdings by over sixty percent. An Austin school was later named in his honor. (1990)",

Hood Camp of United Confederate Veterans and was intended as a residence for disabled and indigent Confederate veterans. Potential residents were required to prove that they had served honorably in the Civil War, that they had a disability that prevented them from supporting themselves, and that they did not suffer from any contagious diseases. \r\n  The Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy led fundraising efforts for the home. In 1886, the John B. Hood Camp purchased sixteen acres with a two-story building at 1600 West Sixth Street, and the Confederate Men\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Home opened later that year. The home was operated by the Veterans\u00E2\u20AC\u2122 Camp with funding from public contributions until 1891, when oversight was assumed by the state of Texas.

Hood Camp of United Confederate Veterans and was intended as a residence for disabled and indigent Confederate veterans. Potential residents were required to prove that they had served honorably in the Civil War, that they had a disability that prevented them from supporting themselves, and that they did not suffer from any contagious diseases. \r\n  The Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy led fundraising efforts for the home. In 1886, the John B. Hood Camp purchased sixteen acres with a two-story building at 1600 West Sixth Street, and the Confederate Men\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Home opened later that year.

In 1950, Mayor Taylor Glass anticipated building a separate, segregated course. However, some city council members thought it was not a cost-effective measure, and on April 5, 1951, councilwoman Emma Long suggested African American golfers be allowed to use existing public courses.

Under the leadership of President Katie Daffan, the Texas UDC began coordination and fundraising to secure a home for needy confederate wives and widows. Through dinners, events, concerts and individual donations, the Texas UDC purchased property and constructed a Richardson Romanesque revival style structure. In addition to several bedrooms and bathrooms, the home featured a parlor, dining area and a hospital. UDC chapters from all over the state donated furnishings for the home. \r\n Due to the cost to maintain the home, the UDC transferred the home to the state of Texas on Dec. 23, 1911. An annex was built that doubled the size and increased the capacity, and a hospital was erected in 1916. The state legislature established the board of control to operate the home in 1920, and then in 1949, responsibility transferred to the board for Texas State Hospitals and special schools.

Potential residents were wives or widows of honorably discharged Confederate soldiers, women who could prove active participation in the Confederate War effort, and women 60 years or older without a means of support. \r\n The Confederate Men\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Home began in Austin in 1884 and the Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter #105 of the Texas Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) made visits, brought gifts, food and clothing to the veterans. Under the leadership of President Katie Daffan, the Texas UDC began coordination and fundraising to secure a home for needy confederate wives and widows. Through dinners, events, concerts and individual donations, the Texas UDC purchased property and constructed a Richardson Romanesque revival style structure. In addition to several bedrooms and bathrooms, the home featured a parlor, dining area and a hospital. UDC chapters from all over the state donated furnishings for the home. \r\n Due to the cost to maintain the home, the UDC transferred the home to the state of Texas on Dec. 23, 1911. An annex was built that doubled the size and increased the capacity, and a hospital was erected in 1916. The state legislature established the board of control to operate the home in 1920, and then in 1949, responsibility transferred to the board for Texas State Hospitals and special schools. This home provided for more than 3,400 indigent wives and widows of Confederate veterans and operated until 1963, when the last residents were transferred to private nursing homes.",

The carnival atmosphere attracted hundreds of visitors each summer.\r\n\r\nThe City of Austin purchased the park for $10,000 on May 31, 1935.  Two weeks later a devastating Colorado River flood inundated the city, swept away park improvements, and filled the pool with debris. With assistance from the federal Works Progress Administration, the city rebuilt the park. It reopened in 1936 as Eilers Park and Deep Eddy Swimming Pool. (1991)",

The Johnsons named the park for a deep hole in the limestone bed of Colorado River at this site that caused the water\u0027s current to from an eddy. Recreational facilities included campsites, picnic areas, rental cottages, and a cable ride into the river.\r\n\r\nMary Johnson sold the park to A. J.Eilers in 1915. He built a concrete swimming pool in 1916 and renamed the resort Deep Eddy Bathing Beach. Managed by George A. Rowley, the resort featured such attractions as silent movies, a ferris wheel, carousel ride,a diving horse show, trapeze swing over the water, a 70-foot slide, and a 50-foot diving tower. The carnival atmosphere attracted hundreds of visitors each summer.\r\n\r\nThe City of Austin purchased the park for $10,000 on May 31, 1935.  Two weeks later a devastating Colorado River flood inundated the city, swept away park improvements, and filled the pool with debris. With assistance from the federal Works Progress Administration, the city rebuilt the park. It reopened in 1936 as Eilers Park and Deep Eddy Swimming Pool. (1991)",

Many descendants still live in the area. After completion of Mansfield Dam in the 1940s, the waters of Lake Travis flooded about half of the acreage. The cemetery was relocated at Teck.

Electric power arrived in the Texas capital in 1895, after the Colorado River was first dammed to generate electricity. The city of Austin has owned its own generation and distribution system ever since, a rarity among large cities. A growing population and post-World War II demand for new appliances and air conditioning increased the need for electricity. In 1948, the city of Austin commissioned a new power generation plant to be built here, just west of the existing site. Designed by the nationally known Kansas City engineering firm of Burns \u0026 McDonnell, the complex developed in two phases in 1950 and 1955. The massive plant included a generator building, which initially housed two Hydrogen-cooled turbine generators but was designed to expand to five as demand increased; outdoor boilers; an oil heating plant; a demineralization building; and a water intake structure. The buildings reflect the Art Moderne style, with site-cast structural concrete, scored concrete panel cladding, metal divided-light windows and glass blocks. The turbine generator building includes distinctive illuminated Moderne graphics in its signage. The buildings are solid concrete construction, although other power plants built by Burns \u0026 McDonnell up to that time had utilized structural steel. On June 2, 1960, the city of Austin posthumously dedicated \u0022Power Plant No. 2\u0022 to Walter E.

Because larger maneuver, parade, and drill areas were needed, the guardsmen worked actively to acquire more land. With state and federal purchases, the camp at its largest consisted of over 430 acres.\r\n\r\nBy vote of guardsmen, the camp was named in 1898 for Adjutant General Woodford Haywood Mabry (1856-1899), who provided forceful leadership for the militia.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 (after the National Guard was created 1906) the State of Texas built an arsenal here for stores formerly held in the Capitol. This was a campsite for United States Army during the first World War, and was principal site until 1928 for annual guard encampments. During World War II, it was an ordnance engine rebuild station for the United States Army.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Texas Department of Public Safety patrolmen were trained at Camp Mabry; Texas Rangers had their training command here until 1953. This has been headquarters since 1954 for the state Adjutant General. Other post installations include Texas Army National Guard state officer candidate school and the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office and Warehouse. (1972)",

They founded the North Galveston, Houston \u0026 Kansas City Railroad and laid out streets in a pattern much like the city of Galveston\u0027s.  Excursion trains brought residents from the Midwest to settle in the burgeoning industrial town until the devastating 1900 storm wiped out North Galveston and ended dreams of Galveston\u0027s longevity as a major seaport.\r\n In 1910 Houston lawyer Joe Eagle purchased the townsite and returned the San Leon name to the community, advertising it as a bayside resort.  Although the 1915 storm did additional damage to the town, Eagle worked to rebuild until the San Leon Hotel burned in 1921.  In the decades between the two world wars, the San Leon area was known primarily for its fig and citrus orchards, and at the dawn of the 21st century its economy was based on the commercial seafood and sports fishing industry.

Boys learned how to ride horses and drive cattle at a young age to earn wages on the ranches. The Western Cattle Trail extended from Mexico through Texas and up to the Canadian border and from 1874 to 1894, it is estimated that thirty thousand cowboys drove seven to ten million longhorns and one million horses through the trail using Bandera as a staging area. Local rodeos began in the 1920s when cowboys who worked the ranches started exhibiting their skills during roundups and on cattle drives. Bandera had its first rodeo in 1924 at Mansfield Park, where rodeos have continued through the years. The Buck and the Bruce ranches took in summer guests holding rodeos as entertainment. Others that followed were the Dixie Dude, Bennie\u0027s U-Bar, and the Twin Elm ranches. Bandera cowboys became famous by earning world champion titles and being inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. In 1938, Toots Mansfield was Bandera\u0027s first world champion in calf roping, earning this title on six additional occasions. He later became the first president of the National Rodeo Cowboy Association which was organized in 1945.

        "DisplayInformation": "The Great Western Cattle Trail (also known as the Old Texas Trail and the Dodge City Trail) was the longest of all 19th century trails used to drive cattle from Texas to distant markets. In 1874, Capt. John T. Lytle and other cowboys led 3,500 cattle from south Texas to Fort Robinson, Nebraska. This path became the Great Western Cattle Trail, one of the most frequented routes for driving cattle across the country. Although the trail was less well-known than the Chisholm Trail, the Great Western Cattle Trail carried cattle for longer than all other trails. Over time, more than seven to ten million longhorns, one million horses and 30,000 cowboys used the trail, according to conservative estimates. The Great Western trail began near Bandera and extended north through Dodge City, Kansas to Ogallala, Nebraska, the Dakotas and into Canada. Bandera served as an ideal staging and departure point because of its plentiful water and grass for cattle. The cattle market fulfilled the Northeast\u0027s high demand for beef, created cattle companies, enterprises and towns along its path and helped revitalize Texas\u0027 post-Civil War economy. Between 1855 and 1890, more than 950 cattle marks and brands were registered in Bandera County. The Great Western Cattle Trail began to lose popularity in 1885, when diseased cattle from Texas prompted many northern states to ban the importation of Texan cattle in warm months, and when increased barbed wire fencing limited cattle drive mobility. The last known drive on the trail occurred when John Rufus Blocker traveled to Deadwood, South Dakota in 1893. In 2004, the Great Western Cattle Trail Association placed its first marker in an effort to place cement markers every six miles along the route. (2014)",

Utesch, who also was from Welcome, provided guidance and leadership at that first gathering.\r\n\r\nThe congregation of Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church held monthly services in its first years. In May 1906, Lutherans in the neighboring community of Cyclone decided to join the Salem church. That union brought about a strength in numbers that allowed the church to call the Rev. August\r\nDziewas as its first resident pastor soon thereafter. Land was purchased for a parsonage, and the congregation acquired the former Terry\u0027s Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church, south, building to serve as its house of worship.

By 1896 the congregation had acquired more land and erected a small white frame sanctuary.  All written records were destroyed in a 1922 fire which burned the parsonage and two outbuildings.  Larger facilities were needed by 1931, so a new church structure was built that year.  Dedication services were held January 10, 1932.  On August 12, 1951, the congregation dedicated its new pipe organ, which at the time was the largest in any Texas Lutheran church.  From its beginning St. John Lutheran Church has served the spiritual and educational needs of the surrounding communities.  Although the last German service was conducted in 1942, the church continues to reflect the ideals and traditions of its founders. (1983)",

The borders of the newly incorporated town made it the largest in the county with nearly 30 square miles which included present Double Oak and Copper Canyon. In 1964, Bartonville was disincorporated and in 1973 a smaller geographical town was reincorporated with the Bartonville Store still at its hub. The store was permanently closed in 2013 but is viewed as the original cornerstone of this rural community.  \r\n",

Trustees George Brooks, Samuel Franklin Thorne and Henry Barnett bought the acreage for thirty dollars. Mount Olive Evergreen Cemetery was also established on the land, just northeast of the church building. In 1912, trustees Abe Yancey, Tom Anderson and F.W.R. Thorne bought an additional acre from Samuel Franklin Thorne and built an addition perpendicular to the sanctuary as a dedicated classroom. Classes continued at Elm Grove until 1957, when the school consolidated with Bastrop.\r\n\tThe 1909 sanctuary is a front gabled rectangular plan building with an offset entrance and spire, shiplap siding and peaked windows.

The rural school enumerated 89 pupils and shared the same frame building as Mt. Olive. Soon the frame sanctuary also proved too small for the growing church.\r\n\tUnder the leadership of Reverend H. W. Luckett (1874-1924), Mt. Olive purchased three acres at this site from Jim Franklin in 1909 for a new church property. Trustees George Brooks, Samuel Franklin Thorne and Henry Barnett bought the acreage for thirty dollars. Mount Olive Evergreen Cemetery was also established on the land, just northeast of the church building. In 1912, trustees Abe Yancey, Tom Anderson and F.W.R. Thorne bought an additional acre from Samuel Franklin Thorne and built an addition perpendicular to the sanctuary as a dedicated classroom. Classes continued at Elm Grove until 1957, when the school consolidated with Bastrop.\r\n\tThe 1909 sanctuary is a front gabled rectangular plan building with an offset entrance and spire, shiplap siding and peaked windows. The 1912 addition, built perpendicular to the chancel, is side gabled with banks of double-hung windows and board and batten siding. The church has continued to serve the community as a cornerstone of worship and social activities.\r\n\tRecorded Texas Historic Landmark \u00E2\u20AC\u201C 2008",

Bates, who is credited with the first irrigation project in the area, began selling two-acre plots of the irrigated farmland, and a settlement grew up near his home.\r\nAfter the selection of Batesville as the Zavala County Seat, Bates conveyed a portion of his land for use as a courthouse square.  The first county courthouse and jail were constructed at this site in 1885.  Built of burnt bricks made from Leona River soil, the two story courthouse featured offices downstairs and a courtroom upstairs.  The structure was used as the county courthouse until 1928, when the seat of government was moved to Crystal City.  The old courthouse then was used for a variety of purposes until it was torn down in 1947.  (1984)\r\n",

An addition built in 1958 provided extra working space and a loading dock at the rear of the structure.  This building continued to serve the Bay City community as a post office until 1989.  During that time it also served as a town meeting place, the site of the Selective Service Board during World War II, a Civil Defense fallout shelter, and a place of refuge from storms and hurricanes.\r\n    On October 30, 1990, after several months of negotiations with the United States Postal Service, the Matagorda County Museum Association purchased the building to house the Matagorda County Museum.\r\n(1992)",

One hundred seventy-seven students registered during the fall 1934 semester, and paid less than $15 per semester in fees. The junior college first shared facilities with Robert E. Lee High School, and classes met at night. In 1935 four women made up the first graduating class, and vocational education was inaugurated with a non-credit class in child psychology. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s name was changed to Lee College in 1948, and a separate campus was first utilized in 1951.

        "SpeakingInformation": "  In 1934, during the Great Depression and after several years of planning, the residents of the Goose Creek Independent School District voted to establish Lee Junior College, stressing the importance of higher education opportunities for area residents. One hundred seventy-seven students registered during the fall 1934 semester, and paid less than $15 per semester in fees. The junior college first shared facilities with Robert E. Lee High School, and classes met at night. In 1935 four women made up the first graduating class, and vocational education was inaugurated with a non-credit class in child psychology. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s name was changed to Lee College in 1948, and a separate campus was first utilized in 1951.

Founded in 1921 as a grade school, it served the children of the Baytown area, as well as those in La Porte, Cedar Bayou, and McNair. Classes were also held in Mt. Rose Baptist Church. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s first principal, Anna B. Edwards, was paid $90 per month. A frame school building constructed at the northwest corner of Carver St. and Oak St. (now Martin Luther King Dr.) Opened in the fall of 1924; a brick addition in 1927 expanded it to the ninth grade. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s name was changed to honor scientist, educator, inventor and botanist George Washington Carver by June 1940, and it was accredited as a four-year high school in 1941. In 1948, a larger, modern campus was opened four blocks east at Carver St. and Lee Dr., and the old building became an elementary school. \r\n  Carver High was consistently ranked as one of the top segregated schools in the state, and students excelled in both academics and athletics.

        "SpeakingInformation": "  The first public school for African American children of this area was Goose Creek School for Coloreds. Founded in 1921 as a grade school, it served the children of the Baytown area, as well as those in La Porte, Cedar Bayou, and McNair. Classes were also held in Mt. Rose Baptist Church. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s first principal, Anna B. Edwards, was paid $90 per month. A frame school building constructed at the northwest corner of Carver St. and Oak St. (now Martin Luther King Dr.) Opened in the fall of 1924; a brick addition in 1927 expanded it to the ninth grade. The school\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s name was changed to honor scientist, educator, inventor and botanist George Washington Carver by June 1940, and it was accredited as a four-year high school in 1941. In 1948, a larger, modern campus was opened four blocks east at Carver St. and Lee Dr., and the old building became an elementary school. \r\n  Carver High was consistently ranked as one of the top segregated schools in the state, and students excelled in both academics and athletics.

The Hall brothers hired atmospheric theater designer John Eberson to redesign the structure, and his exuberant Art Deco interior and Art Moderne exterior featured bold colors and geometric patterns in materials, finishes and fabrics. During World War II, movie stars came here to promote war bond drives. The theater survived flooding damage caused by Hurricane Beulah in 1967 but eventually closed in 1986. The Hall Rialto Preservation Association formed several years later to restore and reuse the historic theater.\r\n\r\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmark - 2007",

        "DisplayInformation": "Bellville General Hospital\r\n\r\n  Bellville was founded as county seat of Austin County in January 1848, on land provided by Thomas Bell, for whom the town was named. The railroad reached Bellville in 1879-80, and the population increased substantially in the ensuing years.\r\n  \r\nIn 1915, Dr. Jubal Allen Neely, graduate of the Galveston Medical School, moved to Bellville and opened a private medical practice. He served in the U.S. Army Medical Corp during World War I and returned to Bellville with an injury. When the injury required bed rest in 1926, Dr. Herbert Edward Roensch, a Bellville native practicing medicine in nearby Kenney, moved to Bellville to help tend to Neely\u0027s patients. They formed a partnership, and in 1928, the two doctors opened Bellville\u0027s first hospital with four beds. That same year, the discovery of an oil field in the area led to an increase in population, and soon plans were underway for a larger hospital.\r\n  \r\nIn 1930, the hospital moved to the Neely Building, still on the town square. Serving an ever-growing population, the hospital again expanded in 1938, and plans for an even larger facility began in 1949. The once private hospital became a corporation, receiving its charter in 1952. A 24-bed hospital opened the following year on land donated by Neely and Roensch. Twenty years later, a 32-bed facility opened, and the former hospital was replaced by a physicians\u0027 clinic. \r\n  \r\nOperating under a voter-approved hospital district, Bellville General Hospital continues to serve the community more than 75 years after it opened with the leadership and support of its professional medical and administrative staff, as well as from the board of directors, auxiliary, foundation and friends.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2003)\r\n",

His anvil (in one of the three original buildings in Belton) was the council table.\r\n     First courthouse was a one-story (16\u0027 x 18\u0027) frame building erected by contractor Thomas T. Havens in 1851, at cost of $199, financed by sale of city lots. On April 1, 1858, the commissioners contracted for a two-story (50\u0027 x 60\u0027) native limestone building with intersecting main halls, fireplaces on each floor, double doors and other fine details.

It was the route from Monclova (crossing the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass) to the missions of east Texas. Probably its trailblazers were buffalos and Indians, or Aztecs on trading expeditions. It was also probably traveled, described and changed in part by French explorer La Salle; by Alonso de Leon and Father Damian Massanet planting missions in east Texas; and by the French nobleman St. Denis seeking trade along the Rio Grande. As the years wore on, it was traveled in 1820 by Moses Austin, as well as by thousands of settlers who followed him.

To the Spanish, El Camino Real was a road traveled for the king \u00E2\u20AC\u201C to colonize, Christianize, seek adventure or look for riches. This road became the most famous. Its many parts were made, discovered or known hundreds of years before 1691, when Domingo Teran de los Rios, first Texas governor, joined and marked the different trails for the king. It was the route from Monclova (crossing the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass) to the missions of east Texas. Probably its trailblazers were buffalos and Indians, or Aztecs on trading expeditions. It was also probably traveled, described and changed in part by French explorer La Salle; by Alonso de Leon and Father Damian Massanet planting missions in east Texas; and by the French nobleman St. Denis seeking trade along the Rio Grande. As the years wore on, it was traveled in 1820 by Moses Austin, as well as by thousands of settlers who followed him. San Augustine, Nacogdoches and San Antonio were its principal cities; inns sprang up along the way. Soldiers and supply trains used it during the Texas Revolution, Mexican War and Civil War. It is still followed in part by this highway.",

The church was free of debt within nine years despite the ravages of drought and hurricane.\r\n   A new building fund committee began its work in 1952. Two years later, church trustees bought a block of property facing Sixth Street on the north side. A large part of the land was a gift from church members in honor of their parents. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on October 27, 1955. The erection of the new edifice took more than a year to complete and included a sanctuary with a seating capacity of more than 400. By the end of 1966, membership had reached 586. The new building was declared free of debt and dedicated on December 14, 1969.\r\n   The First United Methodist Church of Bishop continues in the traditions of its founders with programs of service and worship.

Among the oldest marked graves are those of Barnett Hollingsworth (1801-74), one of the 48 Civil War veterans buried here, and the Rev. James Johnson (1803-77), a Cumberland Presbyterian minister.\r\n   Dresden Methodist Church, serving as a community church, has occupied a site adjacent to the cemetery since the 1850s. Care for the burial ground is provided by the Dresden Cemetery Association, whose members have met annually since its founding in 1877. The plot now (1976) covers 17.09 acres with over 2,000 graves. The pioneer village has vanished, but Dresden Cemetery is still used by descendants of the first settlers.",

Deed records date back to Matthew Mowry who received a Republic of Texas land grant for services in the war for Independence from Mexico.

Holmes, the first doctor. \r\n In the 1870s, the first store in a one-room log cabin opened just south of the town square, operated by William and James Moyers. Other early establishments were a one-room school, the Blue Ridge Masonic Lodge No. 490 and the J.A. Barnett Cotton Gin, along with the variety store, dentist office, Blue Ridge National Bank and hardware store on the town square. Many people in the area were farmers and ranchers and flocked to the two gins located here. Raising cotton, corn, wheat, oats, hay and cattle provided the livelihood for many. \r\n The first Methodist church was organized in 1880 and the first Baptist church organized in 1885. Citizens recall an active Church of Christ as early as 1890. Until 1895, all church services were held in the schoolhouse, with each denomination taking turns. In 1937, the high school was constructed with works progress administration labor.

He was born Ferdinand\r\nCharles von Herff in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany on November 29, 1820, but he\r\nnever used the name Charles. When he later became a United States citizen, he\r\ndropped the von from his name and was called Dr. Herff. In 1847, with a\r\ngroup of idealistic young Germans, die vierziger (the forty), Dr. Herff failed\r\nin an attempt to establish the Bettina Socialistic Colony in Texas. He returned\r\nto Germany and married Mathilde Klingelhoffer (1823-1910) in 1849. The next\r\nyear, they immigrated to New Braunfels and settled in San Antonio. \r\n\r\nHerffs second home here on a ranch in Boerne was a family retreat. Dr. Herff\r\npracticed medicine here and was instrumental in bringing to Boerne the railroad\r\nand Saint Marys Sanitarium. During the Civil War, he served briefly as a\r\nBrigade Surgeon for Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Confederacy. However, the Herff\r\nranch was occupied by Confederate Rangers as Herff was known as a Union\r\nsympathizer. He treated all in need, including Native Americans.

        "SpeakingInformation": "In the 1850s, a few courageous and well-trained European doctors responded to\r\nthe health needs of the citizens of San Antonio. For more than fifty years, Dr.\r\nFerdinand Ludwig von Herff worked tirelessly to provide leadership and medical\r\nknowledge and to improve medical practices in Texas. He was born Ferdinand\r\nCharles von Herff in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany on November 29, 1820, but he\r\nnever used the name Charles. When he later became a United States citizen, he\r\ndropped the von from his name and was called Dr. Herff. In 1847, with a\r\ngroup of idealistic young Germans, die vierziger (the forty), Dr. Herff failed\r\nin an attempt to establish the Bettina Socialistic Colony in Texas. He returned\r\nto Germany and married Mathilde Klingelhoffer (1823-1910) in 1849. The next\r\nyear, they immigrated to New Braunfels and settled in San Antonio. \r\n\r\nHerffs second home here on a ranch in Boerne was a family retreat. Dr. Herff\r\npracticed medicine here and was instrumental in bringing to Boerne the railroad\r\nand Saint Marys Sanitarium. During the Civil War, he served briefly as a\r\nBrigade Surgeon for Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Confederacy. However, the Herff\r\nranch was occupied by Confederate Rangers as Herff was known as a Union\r\nsympathizer. He treated all in need, including Native Americans. Dr. Herff\r\nachieved many medical breakthroughs in surgery, as well as introducing new\r\nprocedures to the medical community. As one of the great pioneer doctors, he\r\nheld many distinguished positions in local and state organizations, and\r\nreceived honors for his many contributions.

Convenient streetcar rides attracted not only townspeople, but saddle-sore cowboys as well.\r\n\r\nBy 1890, when Bonham acquired the steam-car line, mule-drawn cars were being replaced all over Texas.\r\n",

IN 1936 THE CAMPUS INCLUDED A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL AND AS MANY AS FIFTY STUDENTS. \r\n  R. G. COFIELD AND HIS WIFE, MAYE DELLA, CAME TO BORGER IN 1946 TO FURTHER EDUCATION OF BLACK CHILDREN. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MR. COFIELD AS PRINCIPAL AND HIS WIFE AS A TEACHER, THE FACULTY GREW FROM TWO TO SEVEN, A NEW BRICK BUILDING WAS COMPLETED, AND TWO FORMER BARRACKS FROM PAMPA AIR FORCE BASE WERE ADAPTED AS A GYMNASIUM AND ADDITIONAL CLASSROOMS. THE SCHOOL WAS ALSO EXTENDED TO TWELVE GRADES, WITH JOHN L. MILES THE FIRST GRADUATE IN 1949. THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM CONTINUED TO GROW, AND THE DRAGONS AND DRAGONETTES EXCELLED AT BASKETBALL AND OTHER SPORTS. AFTER BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION IN 1954 INITIATED NATIONWIDE DESEGREGATION OF SCHOOLS, THE BOARD OF EDUCATION VOTED TO INTEGRATE GRADES SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE IN SPRING 1956. THAT FALL, BOOKER T. WASHINGTON BECAME AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND OLDER BLACK STUDENTS WENT TO SAM HOUSTON JUNIOR HIGH AND BORGER SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. AS A RESULT OF DESEGREGATION, BOOKER T. WASHINGTON SCHOOL CLOSED IN 1964, AND MOST OF THE TEACHERS LEFT BORGER TO SEEK OTHER JOBS. THE SCHOOL IS FONDLY REMEMBERED AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF BORGER\u00E2\u20AC\u2122S AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.\r\n(2013)",

Said to have originated in 1876, this was the last of the old-time Texas cattle trails, those east of here having been closed by farmers.

This trail started near Brownsville and came up to San Antonio, then northwest through or near Uvalde and Kerrville.  Skirting the Nueces River, it came over the divide, crossing headwaters of the South Llano River, fording San Saba River at pegleg crossing, going downriver about six miles, then turning north.  Near Brady, feeder trails came from Fort McKavett and points west, and from San Saba, to the east.  After leaving Cow Gap (likely so named from Cow Creek, about 500 yds.

SERVICES WERE HELD IN A ROOM OVER SMITH\u00E2\u20AC\u2122S STORE IN DOWNTOWN BRAZORIA UNTIL A PERMANENT BUILDING WAS ERECTED. \r\n IN 1915, THE CHURCH TRUSTEES PURCHASED LAND FROM E. SHELBY SMITH IN THE NEWLY DEVELOPED AREA OF TOWN NEAR THE RAILROAD. BY AUGUST 25, 1916, A BUILDING WAS ERECTED ON THE CORNER OF LOUISIANA AND VIRGINIA STREETS. DUE TO MEMBERSHIP GROWTH IN THE 1920s, THE CONGREGATION BUILT THE FIRST OF MANY ADDITIONS AND RENOVATIONS.

In 1860 he was elected county clerk of Buchanan county (renamed Stephens county in 1861.)  He became a surveyor when the commissioners court assigned him the task of surveying the boundaries of Stephens county.  In 1861 Newcomb functioned as Justice of the Peace, and was appointed collector of the confederate war tax for eleven counties.  He served in a Texas state troops ranger unit during the Civil War.\r\n     His writings have proved an important primary source for historians and archeologists.  As a diarist, Newcomb chronicled the daily life of the pioneers, and carefully described the physical appearance of Fort Davis.  He also told of droves of buffalo nearby, what young people did for entertainment, and the treatment for the sick and dying.  He married Susan Reynolds, who also became a diarist.  Her writings reflect the conditions of the county, and the isolation of the settlers.\r\n     Newcomb died at age 31 in 1870, and is buried here beside his first child, an infant son.  (1996)",
