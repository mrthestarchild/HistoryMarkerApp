        "DisplayInformation": "Sanborn started his career by working for Joseph Glidden's Barb Fence Company in DeKalb, Illinois in 1864. By 1872, he began purchasing horses on the East Coast to sell them in Denver, Colorado with his colleague, Judson P. Warner. By 1875, they were hired by Glidden and Isaac L. Ellwood to sell barbed wire in the West for his Barb Fence Company, later renamed the Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company. They established their headquarters in Houston, and sold barbed wire in Sherman, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. By 1876, they made a profit of US$1 million. \nSanborn took up ranching to promote the use of barbed wire. He purchased a 2,000-acre ranch west of Sherman in Grayson County in 1876. Over the years, this ranch grew to be 10,300 acres. By 1881, working for Glidden alongside William Henry Bush, Sanborn established the Frying Pan Ranch near Bushland, Texas, spanning acres of land in Potter County and Randall County. Furthermore, Sanborn acquired 17,000 acres in Clay County, followed by 40,000 acres in Hall County. Additionally, Sanborn acquired the Bravo Ranch, spanning 120,000 acres in Hartley County. \nBesides promoting barbed wire, Sanborn also used his ranches to breed horses. He bred Percheron and French Coach Horses. He crossed Thoroughbreds and Spanish Mustangs to produce ranch horses. Additionally, he organized an annual horse show in Dallas. \nSanborn was the founder of Amarillo, Texas, which lay on his Frying Pan Ranch. When the Fort Worth and Denver Railway built a stop in the town, he established the Panhandle Loan Association and built the Amarillo Hotel for US$50,000. Three years later, he acquired the Hutchins House and redeveloped it into a hotel in 1892. Subsequently, Sanborn became known as the Father of Amarillo.",

        "DisplayInformation": "The congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South was organized on November 23, 1888, by Reverend Isaac Mills, Reverend Jerome Haralson and eight members. The church held title to Parker’s Chapel, the first church building constructed in Amarillo in 1889. The building initially housed several denominations that later organized and moved into their own buildings. The Methodist congregation grew significantly and, less than ten years later, it was clear that a much larger building was needed. In 1899, Reverend J.A. Whitehurst arrived in Amarillo and deeded a lot on Polk Street to the congregation. A Gothic Revival white-frame church was constructed by W.J. Beck in 1902. Known as the “White Church,” it served the congregation for five years before it was moved across the street to make room for construction of a new, two-story Romanesque Revival style brick church. In 1908, the church changed its name to Polk Street Methodist Church. As attendance grew to over 2,000, the church outgrew its third campus. The Reuben Harrison Hunt Company designed this Gothic Revival brick structure on Polk Street six blocks south of the previous church. The new building opened in 1928 with additions in 1953 and 2012. Details include pointed arched openings, parapeted gables with limestone coping, lancets, pinnacles and pedimented buttresses. Built with Tudor details, including stained glass windows, the church is designed to be more than a house of worship. Theological education classes are held in the building’s many classrooms and community organizations utilize the large meeting halls. This beautiful, historic landmark was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.",

        "DisplayInformation": "Amarillo’s American Legion Post, organized in July 1919, is one of the oldest in Texas, formed two months after the group’s organizational caucus in St. Louis. The post, which officially received its charter in Sep. 1919, is named for David T. Hanson, a popular Amarillo doctor who served in the Spanish-American War and World War I. Volunteering as a surgeon with the 142nd infantry, he was killed while attending to a wounded soldier at St. Etienne, France. Ernest O. Thompson, later mayor of Amarillo, was the first post commander. Hanson Post worked to secure jobs and medical care for veterans, and promoted creation of a veterans hospital in the region. The post also helped coordinate veterans’ affairs before Amarillo received a branch of the Veterans Bureau in 1927. Hanson post also donated clothes, food and toys to needy veterans’ families at Christmas. The post first met in the district courtroom of the Potter County Courthouse before moving to the Woodmen of the World Hall. In 1923, the Municipal Auditorium, dedicated to the war dead, included meeting space for the Legion Post; national post commander Alvin Owsley attended the dedication ceremony. The post later bought a building at Seventh and Madison streets which has been its headquarters ever since. Hanson post developed a ladies auxiliary (1920), junior auxiliary (1923), an early R. O. T. C. Unit (1928) and a Sons of the Legion (1934). In 1939, Amarillo got the Veterans Hospital which Hanson Post and civic leaders worked so hard to secure, bringing an important source of construction and medical jobs for the region. Post membership peaked around 1,200 members following World War II. The post continues to support active duty military personnel and veterans throughout the world.",

In 1921, the Red Brick School was razed to make room for a new, larger Amarillo High School, which opened the next year. The 1300 Polk Street building became Central Junior High School; it was later renamed Elizabeth Nixson Junior High School in honor of a former principal. In 1927, the empty space in Amarillo High School’s u-shape design was filled with a cafeteria, gymnasium and auditorium. Further additions were made in 1951 and 1952. In 1964, Nixson Junior High School was razed; other educational facilities were built on the site. Three years later, Amarillo High School integrated without major incident. A 1970 fire destroyed the main building’s third floor and the auditorium, and damaged the rest of the structure. Students attended classes in usable rooms and in nearby churches until it was decided to rebuild the high school on Danbury Street. The school board sold the block to Amarillo College, and the building at 1200 Polk was razed. Today, other structures from Nixson Junior High and Amarillo High School are still used. Although the former school buildings on Polk Street are no longer employed in primary and secondary education, the schools’ legacy lies in the vital contributions of the former students in the community, state and nation.",
